Initial application skeleton for the NPM registry user reset node app (as per conversation here: https://github.com/isaacs/npm/issues/321).

* DONE - User enters their username.
* TODO - Look up that user account.
* DONE Mint a token good for 24 hours, and put it in a db (or something) along with the account name
* DONE - Email the token to the email address.
* TODO - When presented with a valid token, delete the user account out of the db, and tell them to run npm adduser to re-create it.

Lookup account:

* The form validates the input, but doesn't do a call to the couchdb to validate that it is actually in NPM (TODO).

Delete account:

* The token will be processed, but it doesn't do a call to the couchdb to delete it.
