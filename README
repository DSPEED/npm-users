Initial application skeleton for the NPM registry user reset node app (as per conversation here: https://github.com/isaacs/npm/issues/321).

* DONE - User enters their username.
* DONE - Look up that user account.
* DONE - Mint a token good for 24 hours, and put it in a db (or something) along with the account name
* DONE - Email the token to the email address.
* DONE - When presented with a valid token, delete the user account out of the db, and tell them to run npm adduser to re-create it.

How to use

* Clone this repository
* 'npm link' to get all the dependencies (you do need nodejs and npm!)
* Set the environment variables:

    COUCH=localhost:5984    
    USERDB=_users 
    ADMIN=adminuser:adminpass
    
* Scan through server.js and emailer.js and change the settings to suit yourself.    
* node server.js
