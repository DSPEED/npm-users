Initial application skeleton for the NPM registry user reset node app
(as per conversation here: https://github.com/isaacs/npm/issues/321).

* DONE - User enters their username.
* DONE - Look up that user account.
* DONE - Mint a token good for 24 hours, and put it in a db (or something) along with the account name
* DONE - Email the token to the email address.
* DONE - When presented with a valid token, delete the user account out of the db, and tell them to run npm adduser to re-create it.

How to use

* Clone this repository
* 'npm link' to get all the dependencies (you do need nodejs and npm!)
* Copy the "default-config.js" to "config.js" and fill in all the details.
* node server.js
